This is a beginner-friendly Java program that asks **two users** to enter their usernames and passwords, and then displays the login info using a **reusable method**.

##  Features

- Uses one reusable method for both login messages
- Clean, clear output
- Easy to understand and modify

##  Technologies

##  How It Works

1. Prompts **User 1** to enter a username and password.
2. Prompts **User 2** to do the same.
3. Uses one method called `buildLoginInfo()` to format both users' login information.
4. Prints the results to the screen.
